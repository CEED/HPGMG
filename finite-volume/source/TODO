- cycleTime:  uint64_t nanoseconds to double seconds.  cycles.* convert to double
- iterators.c/iterators.h: box/block element iterators that allow easy replacement of omp workshare with tasks, openACC, etc...
- communication-avoiding smoothers (wavefront, simdized)
- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
- high-order (4th order) operators
  - 13pt constant coefficient
  - 27pt constant coefficient + Mehrstellen
  - 125pt(?) variable coefficient
