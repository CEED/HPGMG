- subdivide ghost zone exchange block copies to increase (easy) thread-parallelism
- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
- communication-avoiding smoothers (wavefront, simdized)
- high-order (4th order) operators
  - 27pt constant coefficient + Mehrstellen
  - 13pt constant coefficient
  - 61pt(?) variable coefficient
