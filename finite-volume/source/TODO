- cubical problem size -> rectahedral problem size ... init problem, restriction rules, etc...
- rectahedral problem size -> arbitrary problem shape...
- cycleTime:  uint64_t nanoseconds to double seconds.  cycles.* convert to double
- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
